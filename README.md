# RxJS-RabbitMQ-streams
> The purpose of this POC is to use RxJS as an interface to RabbitMQ

The curiosity/necessity of use rabbitmq without coupling my code with it took me to study an possible flow to connect it with ReactiveX.

So this is my try.

## Roadmap

* Add an image with the proposed flow to README.md

## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * Work in progress
